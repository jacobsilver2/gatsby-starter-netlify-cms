In 2013, I started a habit of going to my favorite paper store picking out different paper stocks, textures, colors, and envelopes and trying out different techniques: strong color combinations, stencils, laser cutting. I put these together with copy I write to create holiday cards for friends and family each year. It was a fun way for me to extend my holiday wishes, while satisfying my need to hang out in a paper store and make something quick and tactile. These images are some of the cards that I came up with at the time.
