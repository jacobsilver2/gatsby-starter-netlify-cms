When my sister and her then fianc√© came to me with a wedding invite idea where, in their own words, all the information would be on one sheet then folded and mailed, I was excited to translate their vision into a concrete execution. We brainstormed together a list of flora, fauna, and public transportation methods (yes, of all things!) that we put together, I set out to create childlike pencil illustrations that would capture what made them unique as a nature loving couple from the East Coast.

To be honest, I rarely illustrate and don't think I am that great at it. But sometimes I like to push myself out of my comfort zone, try something new, and a sister's wedding invite seemed as good a time as any. In the end the bride and groom were very happy with the result and the color scheme of silver and warm light pinks would then inspire the overall wedding colors.

This piece encouraged me to try something new and made my sister and Ari happy, I consider it a success for all parties involved.
