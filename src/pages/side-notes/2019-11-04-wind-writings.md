**When activated by the wind, colorful pinwheels spin and reveal a field of sound that abstracts spoken text into environmental patterns and textures.**

This traveling installation work fills empty spaces with sound, along with small bursts of color. Text is translated from RSS feeds into sonic patterns in real time based on the proportional speed of the spinning pinwheel, using a set-up with magnets, a hall effect sensor, and an Arduino microprocessor.
