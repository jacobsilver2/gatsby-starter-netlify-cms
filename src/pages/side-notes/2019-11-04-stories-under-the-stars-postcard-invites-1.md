One of my favorite clients to work with is my brother-in-law. I know, working for family can be challenging, but I lucked out. 

For this project, I was tasked with creating the postcard invites for "Stories Under the Stars" an event at the intersection of science, personal experiences, story-telling, and performance. Guests and story-tellers gather for a unique evening of music and stories. For two separate rendition of this event star confetti and colorful pins where photographed to create playful renditions of the night sky in one case and planetary arrangements in another.
