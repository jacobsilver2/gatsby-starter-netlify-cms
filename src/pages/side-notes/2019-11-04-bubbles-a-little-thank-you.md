When my sister and her husband Ari came to me with a request to create a baby shower thank you card from a print of their ultrasound of Bubbles, a then temporary name for my niece Leila, I knew it had to be simple yet special. I went to my trusty list of things I wish I could try out but have not had the project opportunity to and there it was, letterpress printing! Other things I wanted to try out included a luscious beautiful neon red-orange color that would not be stereotypically boy or girl but all inclusively baby, and paper edge painting. The English note read “a little thank you”  and the Arabic versioning I came up with loosely read “a big thank you from a small boo”, using Lebanese vernacular. Each language would be cute in its own way and right.
