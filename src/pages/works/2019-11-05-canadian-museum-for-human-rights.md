# Canadian Museum for Human Rights
## Highly integrated graphic and media design, bilingual exhibits, and a commitment to universal accessibility were key facets shaping the inaugural permanent exhibit of this newly built national museum that engages visitors with international human rights perspectives, struggles, and achievements.

### A diverse range of first-hand accounts and evidentiary, often sensitive, material guided the design throughout the 47,000 sq. ft exhibition, resulting in layering and dimensionality in the graphics and media. Media design was conceived as an extension of the physical design; detailed storyboards of all productions ensured close integration and guided producers.

### Completed at [Ralph Appelbaum Associates.](http://www.raany.com/)
