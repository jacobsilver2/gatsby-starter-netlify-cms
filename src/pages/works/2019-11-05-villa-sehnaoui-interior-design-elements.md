**The design of interior elements for a residence in Lebanon explored three ways of formally and visually experimenting with Arabic lettering and traditional calligraphy, transforming it into a contemporary statement within three-dimensional space.** 

A shelving system is based on an old Islamic calligraphic tradition called square or geometric Kufi, and reveals the names of the homeâ€™s owners. A floor tiling detail and door handle are plays on another Arabic calligraphic script, Naskh, using it both formally and in distorted expressions.
