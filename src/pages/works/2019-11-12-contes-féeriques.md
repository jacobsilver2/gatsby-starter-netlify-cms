# Contes Féeriques

## This five-part artist book is an illustrated fable that plays with storytelling, pattern, and typography to reflect a personal frustration with often-inconsistent recounting of Lebanon’s modern history.

### It brings together custom typefaces used in illustrative ways, playfully rhyming parables, and a cast of animals in allegorical roles to suggest the pitfalls of misinterpreting and rewriting history. The structure of the publication is also performative itself, starting with an accordion-like foldout as the reader’s entry point.

### A [reading](http://dev.uniondocs.org/?p=17771) of Contes Féeriques was performed in collaboration with ArteEast.
### In parallel, an extract was published in ArteEast's quarterly [Shahadat](https://issuu.com/arteeast/docs/fall2012_shahadat/3).
