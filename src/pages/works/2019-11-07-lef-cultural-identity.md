# lef Cultural Identity

## Dramatic shadows bring out the effect of letters shining under the spotlight for a youth theatre in the Netherlands.

### Lef, in Dutch means courage, a word that matches fully with the goal of this youth theatre. The aim is to give young people a platform to express themselves and the courage to perform on stage, become public speakers, and performers. Similarly, the letters of lef come alive as 3-dimensional form physically through cardboard, scissors, and glue, and digitally when the photographs of the paper models are digitized in illustrator.

### Work completed at Studio Olykan in Amsterdam.
