**This bilingual Arabic and English visual identity was inspired by the mirrored facade of the Beirut Exhibition Center, a collaborative environment for art museums, galleries, artist collectives, and cultural institutions.**

Just as the building’s corrugated exterior reflects and distorts an evolving cityscape, the identity’s custom Arabic and Latin type distorts the rules of both typographic languages. The approach was to deliberately not compromise the letterforms of one language to meet the visual language of the other, and instead alter both equally until they mirror each other and create a cohesive visual language that is perceived as one holistic unit.
