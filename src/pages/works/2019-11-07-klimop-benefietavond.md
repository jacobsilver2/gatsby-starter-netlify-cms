# Klimop Benefietavond

## This booklet places children in a colorful surrealist environment for a fundraiser aimed at teaching children about nature and the wilderness outside manicured parks and concrete playgrounds.  

The 16-page booklet functioned as an invitation to a VIP fundraiser dinner in De Nieuw Kerk Amsterdam for the Klimop project. The project holds various programes and activites that teach children about real and untamed nature outside of their daily encounters with parks. The design work included a custom illustration for the cover as well as photography throughout the interior.  

Work completed at Studio Olykan in Amsterdam.
