# Enlarged to Show Detail

## This set of colorful installations is an evolving study of pattern, scale, order and disorder, and interplays between physical and digital processes. 

### The work began with hundreds of dots punched from Orbit Gum packages that were enlarged and arranged in patterns both random and highly purposeful. Once a set of principles and visual language were established, the project grew to an exploration of these patterns in different physical spaces, in anaglyph prints as rendered imagery, within projected and 3D virtual environments, and as textures to produce sound.
